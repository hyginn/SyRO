name: modify component
def: "Roles that physically modify individual components of a system. Examples include signal-peptide or pro-domain cleavage, myristoilation, or covalent and non-covalent addition of prosthetic groups. However phosphorylation would typically be a part of system regulation: a functional role; and ubiquitination would be a part of system destruction." []
